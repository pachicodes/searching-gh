# Live user Search

Live user search is an App made in Vanilla javaSrcript that uses the GitHub publish API and searchs from an user profile, displaying their avatar, logins and bio.

## Resources
I used pure JavaScript and styled with [Primer style CSS](https://primer.style/css/), a  CSS framework by Github.
Github's [Search API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search) was used as well.
